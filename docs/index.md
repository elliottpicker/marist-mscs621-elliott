# Elliottchat

Welcome to Elliottchat

Elliott chat is a message board service where users can post messages for other viewers to see and respond to. Chat offers features such as language detection, language translation, text to speech, and watson analyze. All chat is in one main chat stream as opposed to multiple diverging threads. This offers a more classic chat room feel, and is usable for a small group of contributors.

Please see the [Readme file](https://github.com/elliottpicker/marist-mscs621-elliott/blob/master/sample-microservice/README.md) for more detailed description of how the elliott chat service works and for deploying your own elliott chat server.
