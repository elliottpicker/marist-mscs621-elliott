# Welcome to Elliottchat

Elliott chat is a message board service where users post messages for other viewers to see and respond to. Chat offers features such as language detection, language translation, text to speech, and watson analyze. All chat is in one main chat stream as opposed to multiple diverging threads. This offers a more classic chat room feel, and is usable for a small group of contributors who want to stay current with all messages exchanged. Because it is lightweight users can join the chat from any platform or browser and join the chat quite easily and quickly. All you need is access to a web browser and the specific link for the chat group instance.

Please see the [Readme](https://github.com/elliottpicker/marist-mscs621-elliott/blob/master/sample-microservice/README.md) for more detailed description of how the elliott chat service works and for deploying your own elliott chat server.
